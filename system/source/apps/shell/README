To add your own functions to the shell:


In your functions/myfunc.cpp file:

  #include "../flist.h"

  create a "struct function_info info_myfunc"
  create a "int myfunc_main( int argc, char **argv )"

Then, in "flist.h", add one to the TOTAL_FUNCTIONS definition.
Then, in flist.cpp, add your "struct function_entry" to the functions[] array and include your "functions/myfunc.h" declarations along with the rest of them.


NB:  Keep your function names unique to your function or else they probably will collide with other functions.

Look at functions/help.cpp, functions/help.h, etc for an example.
