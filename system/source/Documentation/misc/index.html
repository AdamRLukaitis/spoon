 <H1>Documentation</H1>

 <P>
 The following documentation has been generated by doxygen output
 and has been customised to look cool-ish. I've decided that it's
 a little tricky to get doxygen output to look nice and I still have
 a long way to go until it gets close.  Let me know if you find 
 something wrong.
