  If you're reading this documentation, they're you're 
  probably only interested in the OS-dependant functions 
  which you need to implement in order to port the libUNIX 
  library to your particular platform.  The OS dependant 
  functions are all located in the OS subdirectories. Each
  platform has it's own sub directory in that sub directory.

  Here is the documentation:  \ref OSFUNCS	"OS functions."
  
  There are three steps:
  
  	- Create your own OS subdirectory.
  	- Implement the OS functions according to the documentation.
	- Edit the Makefile to compile for your particular OS.


  Please have a look at the spoon functions to get an idea 
  of how things should work.
